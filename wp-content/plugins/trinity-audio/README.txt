== Trinity audio usage terms ==

The Trinity Audio plugin provides a Text to speech service, which is performed by Trinity Audio.

As such, the service is required to make calls to Trinity‚Äôs backend servers.
By activating the plugin you consent to our T&C as stated below:

[Service Terms & Conditions](https://trinityaudio.ai/wp-plugin-terms/)
[Privacy policy](https://trinityaudio.ai/privacy-policy/)

== Settings and configurations ==

The following are configuration options you can modify as you see fit:

* __Default language:__ The language of your content. In case you have multiple, you can also control the language on the post level.
* __Default Gender:__ the default gender voice for each post.
* __New post default:__ Specifies whether the player is automatically enabled for all new posts. Choose this option if you want [Trinity Audio](https://trinityaudio.ai/) to add an audio player for each new post.
* __Player position:__ The position of the audio player on your page. We recommend placing the player before the main article text.
* __Player label:__ Specifies optional text you‚Äôd like to be shown above the audio player (HTML tags are supported with this label).
* __Display "Powered by Trinity Audio":__ choose if you want to display credit next to the player. We‚Äôd very much appreciate it if you choose to give us credit.
* __Resource preconnect:__ this feature will allow us to load the player faster on your page so we strongly advise enabling it.
* __Add post title to audio:__ If enabled, each audio file will start by reading the post title.
* __Add post excerpt to audio:__ If enabled, each audio file will read an excerpt from the post at the beginning of the audio (after the title, if chosen).
* __Skip HTML tags:__ Use this if you want to avoid generating audio for specific parts of posts based on the tags (content blacklist).
* __Allow shortcodes:__ By default, the Trinity Audio player will read only the textual content of your post and will filter out all additional texts generated using plugins or shortcodes. If you would like to add shortcodes that you would like the player to read, please add them using comma delimiter. For example: gallery, myshortcode. After you change those settings, make sure to use ‚ÄúActivate for all posts‚Äù to allow those configurations to update.
