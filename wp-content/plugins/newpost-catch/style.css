/*
Newpost Catch StyleSheet

With the version up of the plug-in, so will be overwritten "style.css" file each time,
I think how to directly edit the "style.css" file and how would you or declined.
If you wish to apply a CSS style on its own,
In the "/wp-content/themes/theme directory/css/" as you please create a "newpost-catch.css".
Please the name of the file to create and "newpost-catch.css". The other is the file name, does not apply.
